## Native
Native mobile apps are developed specifically for a particular mobile platform using the platform's native programming languages and development tools. For example, iOS apps are typically developed using Swift or Objective-C, while Android apps are developed using Java or Kotlin. Native apps are designed to take advantage of the specific features and functionality of the platform they are developed for, resulting in a highly optimized user experience.

## Hybrid
Hybrid mobile apps, on the other hand, are developed using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and are wrapped in a native container that allows them to be installed and run on a mobile device. Hybrid apps can be developed once and deployed across multiple platforms, making them more cost-effective than developing multiple native apps. However, they may not be as optimized for a particular platform as a native app, and may not have access to all of the device's features and functionality.
